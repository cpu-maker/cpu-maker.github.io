    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p> In Albuquerque, there is about 2,960 individuals that are homeless, which is unacceptable, and should be solved, by giving free food to the homeless, temporary shelter, or simple, cheap donations to trusted sites that help the homeless.

      POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
      ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
      When temperatures drop to dangerously low levels, the City will put its winter sheltering plan into action to help prevent cold-related injuries such as frostbite and hypothermia. By closely watching weather forecasts and changing conditions,
     the City can respond quickly when extreme cold is expected. This approach allows the City to reduce health risks and make sure safe shelter, warming spaces, and critical support are available to those who are most vulnerable during severe winter weather.

        The city can also play a major role by providing essential services like shuttle transportation, safe shelter, access to healthcare, support for recovery from substance use, and regular meals. These resources do more than meet basic needs, they give people 
      experiencing homelessness a sense of stability, safety, and dignity. When individuals have reliable support, it becomes easier for them to focus on improving their health, rebuilding their lives, and eventually finding long-term housing. Even small forms of 
      assistance can make a meaningful difference, and together, these services can substantially improve quality of life for homeless individuals. </p>
