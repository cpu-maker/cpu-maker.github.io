    <p> In our experience at the homeless shelter, Joy Junction in Albuqueuque, New Mexico, we found out that homeless people have a very hard life. They have struggles, such as sharing the same room with strangers.
      Some of Albuquerque's homeless population have children that they have to take care of.  We know that they get food, drinks, basic shelter, and clothing.
      We also know that they stay at the shelter anywhere from 2 weeks, to years. Overall, Joy Junction is an amazing place that offers free food and lodging for those who need it.
